# jpalite

Jpalite is a Lightweight Java Persistence package which builds on the [OrmLite](http://ormlite.com) lightweight Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Java package. 
It is a persistence framework created using the JPA Archecture as a blue print. It is suitable for embedding in resource-constrained platforms such as Android. 
Jpalite implements a lightweight selection from the interface dedined in version 2 of the JPA API - refer <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/jpa/2.2/api/">javax.persistence</a> 
package. JPA features include an entity manager factory, named queries and integrated support for transactions. For more details, refer to 
[Lightweight JPA in a nutshell](http://cybersearch2.com.au/develop/jpa_intro.html)></a>

   
Jpalite is potentially portable to any database supported by OrmLite - refer [Database-Notes for Supported Databases](https://ormlite.com/javadoc/ormlite-core/doc-files/ormlite.html#Database-Notes) with
builtin support currently provided for H2 and SQLite.
